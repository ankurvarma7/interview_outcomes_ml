        "Interviewer: So how are you doing today?|Interviewee: Um  pretty good. Um   yeah.|Interviewer: Good. So tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: So  um  my name is Dina Wong. I'm a student at MIT. I'm in my third year. I'm majoring in course six seven which is biological engin-um  biologic-um  Computational Biology. Um It's pretty new so it only like existed my freshman year.|Interviewer: Oh wow|Interviewee: So yeah  so I've been taking a lot of computer science and technology classes. Um in my free time I like to  um  write for the Tech and a be edit  um articles at the  um the student newspaper  for the student newspaper. Um I also like to bake and like um like exercising and running  stuff like that.|Interviewer: Great what are your career goals.|Interviewee: So currently I'm looking for an internship for the summer. Um  I actually um  I'm exploring like the industry side of um like computer science ummm and I think that if I find a position or if I find like the industry side like really suits me that I would want to go for like um being hired by a company after I graduate.|Interviewer: Great. Ok. So tell me about a time you've demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Ok. Soo this I guess this happens quite a bit during a my stint as um campus life editor of the Tech. So a what happens is  um  like um  for my section I have to a make sure that the publication is like going out on time.|Interviewer: mhm|Interviewee: So  um  one time I demonstrated leadership was in getting a um  column for for the campus life section. So there was a um  the precedent of the Pan-Hellenic society um want to have like a column in the Tech for Greek life. And so um  I negotiated with her to like um  sort to arrange how the column would work  because like um  I guess we both had the same like um  intent of how we should like publish articles  but her ideas were slightly different from mine in that she  if your original idea was that she wanted to  I could  it was kind of like advertisement in the Tech and um  people like  like the Tech is a newspaper you don’t like necessarily want articles to be like advertising sororities so we made a deal with her to like um  write articles that would be more about the personal side and not like um to avertisey.|Interviewer: Ok great. So  tell me about a time you were on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Hmm  Ah...Um I guess again probably using um  let me see..ok so I guess again on  for the Tech cause it's like my major leadership my pretty main extracurricular. Um  I guess um  what happened was um  shit  um I really don’t know how to answer these type of questions sorry.|Interviewer: It's ok  take your time.|Interviewee: Um...|Interviewer: It doesn't necessarily be extracurricular either.|Interviewee: Um...Ok I guess I'll go back to high school then. So in high school I was on the cross country team and um  so what happened was we a like we're  we're competing right so we um  so we had to like  um train in groups so on so on team sports and what happened was kind of that the  um so there's a girls team and a boys team and like um the boys team a was  i guess people the boys were like motivated and things like that and like they would um  and the girls team was like less motivated and wha  and so since they were less motivated they would do stuff like if the coach asked you to like run around this block than they would like sort of cut  take short cuts and stuff like that. Um  I guess what happened was my um  there was another student on the team who was also  who was also like really motivated and I wanted to improve running so I think initially I guess we sort of tried asking people like Hey um  could you not do that?  but eventually what happened was I guess we  me and the other more motivated girl trained with the boys team because that was really the only way  like I mean there's  there's motivating people  but in the sense like they have to want to do it themselves so I guess that's what happened.|Interviewer: Ok.  Great. So can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: OK  Um  I would  let me think. One of my  I guess one weakness I have is um  well MIT is full of smart people right. Um  if everybody is like always doing like these amazing products and projects and I mean like coding since they were like nine years old and stuff  so because of the like abundance of geniuses I sometimes I feel like I'm not as at their level. So um  I guess what I try  what I try to do is like I  I was  feeling badly  but then I realized. Well first of all I guess everybody has to start somewhere. I've been like training my own skills like  reach up to the  to learn more in depth and eventually I'll get that good  just takes like practice and I've also been like just sort of telling myself that it's  to like just apply to things and like don’t  and I guess sort of fake it till you make it right. So make like um  project the image of like confidence and then it will probably come.|Interviewer: Great. And last question. Why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Well um  so I've been learning a lot about um  computer science since I was here. I've um  I am a pretty reliable person so like for example during the Tech I always like am reliably like editing everything  getting thing in time  on deadline. Though if you gave me an assignment then I would reliably like a work on it and um and I  and not procrastinate or anything like that. Um I'm pretty good at learning as demonstrated by my ability to succeed at MIT and um I also um  I would a really enjoy working and contributing to the Google community as a person and a I hope that a  I would be able to produce um  good products.|Interviewer: Great"

        "Interviewer: So  how are you doing today?|Interviewee: I'm doing very well  thanks. How are you?|Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: I'm currently a junior  pursuing a degree in both computer science and business and what's really drawn me to both of these is the fact that they involve a lot of problem solving and a lot of interpersonal dynamics. A lot of interesting questions come up where it’s a lot of actually thinking innovatively and that’s why I’ve chose to major in both of these and  actually  that’s why I’m interesting in consulting is because it’s a good application of the problem solving that I’m doing in both of those.|Interviewer: Tell me about a time you’ve demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Umm  recently  I was in a group project where each of us kind of had our own task to do and it was a very straightforward class project  however  umm  these was  I noticed a lack of communication  a lack of set deadlines  so  umm  in that case  I kind of stepped up. I organized communication between all of us. I really got us on the same page and pushed us to a strict deadline and  you know  it’s a good thing I started when I did because otherwise we would have missed the deadline. Umm  I’ve also had a lot of leadership positions if you want something a little bit more structured.|Uh huh.|Would you like me to tell you about one of those?|Interviewer: Yeah  that’d be great.|Interviewee: Okay. Umm  last semester I was an event director for my sorority and what I had to do for that  the biggest event  especially logistically  fell under my responsibilities  so I  with a $2 200 budget  organized a dinner event for 200 people at restaurants across Boston  so this involved  umm  finding places  making all food allergies were taken care of  really finding out what everyone in my sorority needed and wanted with their evening  and this also involved a lot of delegation because  you know  there were about 20 restaurants involved and I couldn’t personally be in charge of all of those  so I had to delegate out to a committee  make sure that they knew what was happening  manage the risk aspect of it by keeping track of who had left  who hadn’t gone as yet  everyone knew their reservations  how to get there  how to get back. So  in that case  it was kind of a different style of leadership with more of delegation and things like that.|Interviewer: Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Umm  let me see. I guess the first thing that comes to mind is that same item I was just talking about where we weren’t all on the same page and not communicating.|Mmm. Uh huh.|Umm  I can also try to think of something else if you don’t mind giving me just a minute.|Interviewer: Sure.|Interviewee: Umm  so I guess  in one of my classes last year  we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how  umm  and the way we kind of resolved that issue  because clearly  as an aspect  it needed to get done  we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out. So the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time  whereas for the rest of us  we were more interested in the actual material  so we found a mutually agreeable solution.|Interviewer: Great. Tell…Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you’re doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: Yes. Umm  I think one of my weaknesses is that I tend to get very excited about everything I’m doing  you know  that  like  I’m a double major because I started in computer science and then I went oh  management really excites me too  I want to do that as well  which  in the past  has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit  which  as a result  when you’re really excited about everything  but then you try to do everything  the amount of commitment you give to each one is reducing  but I’m conscious of this year. I cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars and…especially because last year  while doing all of those  I wasn’t sleeping as much  which  you know  while I was still there and pulling my share and everything  you know  it was harder to be a full present member of anything if you’re tired. So this year I kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and I’m aware of that  so when I feel myself reaching my limit  I’ll actually try to prioritize more.|Interviewer: Great. And why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: As I mentioned before  what I’m studying in school is very applicable to consulting  but  in addition to that  I’m really excited about the work that consultants do  especially  as I mentioned  I’m very interested in a wide range of fields and with you consulting you really get to explore a lot of those  delve into them  and in consulting I’d get to apply my favorite aspects of computer science and management both  which is  again  the problem solving  the thinking innovatively. These are all things that are very important to a consulting company and that is exactly what I love to do  so I think I would have that passion and drive that makes every member of your company that I’ve spoken to really engaging and it seems  from all of my previous conversations with them  that they’re really excited about this  which is  you know  exactly what I would hope to bring as well."

        "Interviewer: How are you doing today?|Interviewee: Um. I'm good. How are you?|Interviewer: I'm doing well. So  tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Um. I'm a core 16 here at MIT  which is aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Um. I'm a junior. Um. And my experience has been last summer I worked with NASA Glenn Research Center doing  ah  interplanetary rover work. Um. I was. |Um doing design work with Jeff Landis as my mentor. Um. So  ah  yeah I had a really good time working on that project. Um. Doing a lot of (inaudible) coding. Making a lot of design decisions. Um. As well as ah separately working on a project with just my fellow interns where we  um  where we built a autonomous navigation system for a Dropsonde. Um which is a meteorological measuring device. Um but we didn't worry about the Dropsonde itself  we were just concerned with building a navigation system.|Interviewer: Mm hmm.|Interviewee: Um. So  that it could be recovered by  um  the people who are using it. Um  and I personally worked on the steerable para-foil parachute for that.|Interviewer: Great. Alright. So can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?|Interviewee: Um. Yes. I can. Um. When we were working on the Dropsonde project which I mentioned before  um  there was um  some question about whether we were gonna be able to get a good drop site for it. Um  because in order to test how the navigation system worked we had to have the thing flying for a significant period of time. Um. So  it was fairly...it takes um  not very long for most things to fall from reasonable height. So we had to find a really good drop location.|Interviewer: Mm hmm.|Interviewee: Um. And we were having a lot of trouble with that. And  um  we...we were pursuing some options with working with NASA  um  but it didn't look like they were gonna work out. And I took the initiative  um  and I went and I contact the owner of this airport where we had been skydiving there previously there in the summer. Um. |So we'd like spoken the owner there before  but not like  not about anything official. We just said hi  we've skydived at your airport. Um. But  I called him  talked to him about it  um  and got actually um  a plane and a free flight for our time to go and be able to drop our (inaudible) um project  which was pretty significant for the success of the project.|Interviewer: Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team and face a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Well I guess I should probably pick a different time that I was working on a team. Um. So  um  when..for the Venus rover  which was the other project that I worked on last summer. Um  we had  um  we basically started just with with nothing. Um  because  um  this  this idea's really like in early design phases. It's not like..there's no Venus rover being built by any team. It's just people like sitting down working equations figuring out what would be feasible for a Venus rover. |Um  so there's a flexibility there. Lot of room to sort of um figure out what we thought would work out best. And initially there is  um  there are two basically competing ideas. Um  there was the idea of using  ahh  wind turbine  um  to power the rover. Verses having actually be a land sailer. Um. And  I mean there was no clear answer regarding which one of those was better. |The wind turbine had some advantage in that it would be able to sit and charge  what would the term...the....it would be able to sit still and um  accumulate power as the wind blew on it so it wouldn't have to be moving constantly. Um  where is the land sailer would have to have some threshold level of wind to move to work (inaudible) friction. |It didn't have that then it wouldn't be able to do anything useful. Um  so in that way the turbine seemed a little bit less risky  but a turbine also has more moving parts. Um  and it would require a little bit more on the electronics side and that's riskier as well. Um  so it was...um  so yeah  it was not a clear decision. |Um  and  basically the team was split between wanting to do the turbine wanting to do the land sailer. Um  so  what we ended up doing was  um  we...I was pro turbine so I ended up doing an analysis of the wind turbine. Um  and my fellow intern was pro land sailer. Did a analysis of the land sailer. Um  neither of us did anything super in depth. But we just did  the um a basic analysis and then we compared our numbers. |We looked through each others processes. Um made sure that we were sort of working from the same assumptions. Um  which we were  I mean cause I mean we both like did an honest job with it. Um  and then we just went based on the math. Which one seemed like it was gonna work out better. Um  so it ended up being non confrontational.|Interviewer: Good. And which ended up working better?|Interviewee: The turbine did. Which I was happy about.|Interviewer: OK. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: Um. Yeah. I am not extremely well organized. Um  so  ahh  yeah. My ...my work tends to be a little bit of a mess and I have trouble meeting deadlines. Um. But I ...um  overcome it just by recognizing something that....recognizing that something that will happen to be where my work will become sloppy and I will miss deadlines if I don't really pay attention to it. Um  so  I do writing down deadlines keeping a Google calendar. Um. Trying to keep myself on top of things.|Interviewer: And why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Um. I think you should hire me because  um  I am intelligent and hard working. Um  and I think...I think my grades at MIT really prove that I am intelligent and hard working. Um  and  I think that  as well as that I also have the experience that you would want at JPO. Working on interplanetary rovers  I've done that before. Also worked on teams um  to try to accomplish goals. Um  so I think that really I am a pretty well qualified applicant for this position.|Interviewer: Great."

I'm a senior right now. |Interviewer: Uh-huh. |Interviewee: And I'll be graduating [??]|Interviewer: Uh-huh. Do you think you're a leader?|Interviewee: Yeah. |Interviewer: Tell me why.|Interviewee: Uh  to me a leader is somebody who takes initiative  and like creates a vision when they're given a blank slate. Uh  when  when I think somebody is a leader they  they don't have to be told what's done  or what needs to get done. And they form the infinite choices and possibilities can quickly pick up two or three  and make a decision. And also like get other people excited about it and organized.|Interviewer: Very good. Uh  do you think you're a team player? Give me an example of a time you were on a team  and you faced a challenge. How did you overcome that?|Interviewee: Hum  Oh yeah. Obviously I do think I'm a team player. I'm trying to think of an example. One specific challenge. The uh  for the [??] project you do as a senior. |Interviewer: Uh-huh. |Interviewee: We had to ah  my group was in charge of analysing the materials  and we  of the section that I got asigned was  was ah  within our team we did like a self ah  splitting it up. And I got like a way way heavy load  and somebodies got to really like move. So it was like pretty  I didn't know if I should talk to somebody else about it or something like that. And I decided like if we were going to do it as a team. Then we're going to have to be on the same page. So at some of my meeting we made sure to split it up a little more evenly. |Interviewer: That's very good. So uh  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?|Interviewee: To never have to sleep. Like realistically? Is this like ah...|Interviewer: Yeah something  something that you need to improve upon. I vote to not being able to sleep as well  but unfortunately...|Interviewee: Not going to answer things like that. |Interviewer: Uh  I would like to teleport as well  but uh...|Interviewee: Uh  definitely to be more organized. So a lot of time I'll get like  my notes will get messy  and stuff like that. Organization. I've been working on it  but it's not where it needs to be.|Interviewer: Very good. That's a problem that afflicts us all. |Interviewee: Yeah.|Interviewer: Uh  so do you have a job you'd like to have? Do you have in mind?|Interviewee: I do.|Interviewer: Okay. So can you tell us why you deserve this job?|Interviewee: Uh  cause I work well with other groups  and this job requires like small groups to work together to accomplish things. |Interviewer: Uh-huh. |Interviewee: And a small group is like the perfect environment for me to do work that is collaborative  but it's not like bureaucratic. |Interviewer: Hum. |Interviewee: So  so this is like the perfect environment  and uh  and I have like some experience in the area. But more importantly like I  I figure things out and get them done. Like as they need to be  so people don't have to tell me what to do  or watch over me and stuff like that. Like it's  if I want something to be accomplished like we'll work with a team to get it done. Without like somebody telling you or watching you whatever. |Interviewer: Oh well thank you. I appreciate you coming here today for this interview.|Interviewee: Yup."

        "Interviewer: How are you doing today?|Interviewee: Great  hahaha.|Interviewer: Tell me more about your background.|Interviewee: More about my backround  well... I'm from Canada  but I grew up in South Florida because  you know  one day my parents just decided that it was too cold *interviewer laughs* so they literally just decided to pick up and move. Uhh  so I basically lived there my whole life until I decided to come here for school  and  you know  since then I've just been going through MIT... I'm trying to do a lot of pre-med things. I like to volunteer. Uhhh  you know  strong family values  things like that. So...|Interviewer: Great! Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.|Interviewee: Yes. Because  umm  everything I try to do  I  you know  always try to do the best that I can  and  even if I'm not the best at it  that-- the effort  like that alone should be enough to sort of inspire somebody  even if they're better at it than I am  you know. I find that's inspiring  you know  seeing someone try  you know  and trying their hardest. And maybe they're not the best at it but  you know  the effort that they put into something  is sort of something to be looked high upon  so...|Interviewer: Okay  okay  and do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee: *hushed laughter* Umm  sure. Sooo  basically almost every night when you go home to problem set... You know  problems sets here are sort of designed to be group efforts  at least in chemical engineering they are  and often you and your group are working and you come to a crossroads  you know  part of the group thinks you should go one wan and part of the gorup things we should go another way. And  you know  kind of something that I've learned is that you can't shut down other people's ideas... Umm  so  I think something really important to do is... WE end up trying both ways  and maybe it takes us a little blt more effot  and maybe it takes us a little bit longer  but then we know for sure  like  you know  Okay  this way definitely didn't work  and you know maybe this way is the better way to go... but at least we didn't just  you know  diverge one way  and think like Oh  maybe we should have done it another way  so I think that's pretty important.| |Interviewer: If you were given the opportunity to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: Umm  hmmm. I wish I was taller *both laugh*. You know  sometimes  I guess I always think that  you know  I'm right  and  you know  it takes people some convincing and I--I know I'm definitely not right all the time but I think that's kind of  you know  like  human nature  like  no-one ever wants to think that they're wrong   but  uhh  you know something I've learned here is |you're not always right  and everyone here is pretty smart  and they also have some really good ideas  and  it's really important to sort of take into account what others are thinking and  you know  that's just sort of the best way to progress  at least in our work here  it's... No-one could ever finish something  for example  the problem sets like I was talking about before  you can't finish a problem set by yourself. You need to get input from other people  and like  becoming open-minded was definitely  like  a challenge for me  but it's something that I've been working on  and something I think I've definitely got a lot better at since coming to MIT  at least  so...|Interviewer: And  why do you think you should get into medical school?|Interviewee: Heh  ha  because I've been working my but off *both laugh* Umm  you know  it's just something that I'm very passionate about. I'm really  not... I would do it for free  like I'm  you know people say they want to do medicine for the money  or you know  'cause it's a high-power career  but you know   it's the only type of thing... and... that I see myself being satisfied with in a long-term career. It's... I love being part of  like  the medical community right now  you know  if it's my work between being an EMT  working at the hospital... you know  working as a tech... These are all things that I would love and I would do. I'm happy to wake up in the morning and go do these things  and  you know  I wanna say it's like my burning passion like  it is  you know  my drive and  you know  I think that's probably the most important thing when you're looking for a candidate for medical school or for a job. Umm  it's knowing that  you know  they're not gonna  you know  one day decide that they don't wanna do this anymore  and they're not kind of like Yeah  I'm not sure if I wanna go to med school. It's like  no  I've been wanting to do this since I was like  nine years old  and every single thing I've done to work my way towards it... it's just made me fall in love with it even more.|Interviewer: Okay."

So I am match-making computer science double major at MIT.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmmm|Interviewee: I worked in the product-tech and business space before umm doing both uh front end web development  for example  at Next Job and product management  for example  at Douche Ban  the German railway and Disney Parks and Resorts online.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmmm. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why. |Interviewee: Sure. I think I..I am. Umm one example of that is I'm the president of Baker House-it's a dorm at MIT.|Interviewer: Oh  yes. |Interviewee: Umm and as part of that I--there's about twenty members of the executive committee um and we run um events during the year- about a fifty thousand dollar budget. Um so making sure all of those run run smoothly um  that there aren't conflicts between members of the team  that the umm other business of Baker House gets done and gets done in an efficient way and a way that's good for the residents that are there.|Interviewer: Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time you faced a challenge while you were on a team and how you went about resolving it. |Interviewee: Sure  so this sem-or this past summer at Disney uh we had a challenge once with the time zones um and how they would be uh and how the app would be able to use time zones. So  we uh spent some time to got everyone on the phone together on a conference call and talked about umm what the app would have to do in order to support time zones. |Interviewer: Okay. Umm if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be? |Interviewee: Sure. I think the..the one thing that I um you know  maybe I..I...maybe it's..it's a false sort of sense of of what umm of something but at MIT it always seems like some people get the answers to some questions faster than I do and umm you know  it's it's probably just you know  their particular field that they are good in but you know some magical way of of you know  being able to do that would be good. |Interviewer: Well thank you. Umm so I guess my final question is think of that one job..|Interviewee: Uhh huh...|Interviewer: That you would like to have...|Interviewee: Yep..|Interviewer: Doing what? |Interviewee: Mmm-hmm |Interviewer: Good  okay.
